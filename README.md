# FeedMe
FeedMe is a randomized food delivery app for android. It is still in development. 

The goal for the app is to be able to open up the app on your phone and select the number of people you are with and press the launch button. The app will then choose a restaurant and a meal based on your preferences and order the food for you, having it delivered directly to your location, all at the touch of a button. 

Currently the app has two restaurants implemented: Dominos and PapaJohns and JimmyJohns is soon to be added.

This is the first and main screen of the app when you open it.
